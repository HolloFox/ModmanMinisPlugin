## ThunderMan Plugin
Alpha version of Custom Mini Plugin Integrated with Thunderstore and R2ModManager. Easy custom Asset Install.
The Alpha version currently has a slightly modified CMP compiled into this to get it public. 
Future plan is to update it to fully depend on CMP keeping the plugins in their respective scope.

## Installing 
This package is designed specifically for R2ModMan and Talespire. 
You can install them via clicking on "Install with Mod Manager" or using the r2modman directly.

## Usage
This plugin allows easier access to minis downloaded via r2modman.
Simply Downloading a minis pack mod via r2modman will give TaleSpire access to it.
By pressing Ctrl+1 you load a list of available minis to replace the selected mini.
The nature of this plugin is designed for r2modman only for simpler custom mini installation.
